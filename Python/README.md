# Coding Sample Python

These are hand selected assignments from my Data Structures and Object Orientend programming course.

I have included the problem description PDFs, along with the provided tests that we were graded based on.

These all use python3.

If you do not wish to read all three, I suggest reaading HW07, a divide an conquer algorithim implimentation for finding the largest sum of sequential items in an array.
